 2. Intro to OOP Class & Object
 
 The basic of OOP and creation of Java class
 Files: Human.java and Earth.java
 
 3. Program Flow and Using the Constructor
 
 How to use a constructor.
 
 4. Application Runtime
 
 The difference about class and object
 
 5. Java Behind The Scenes
 
 Memories: Stack: the place where application piles the methods invocations
           Heap : memory where variables are save
		   Garbage Collector: release not used variables in heap

 7. Abstract Data Types
		   
 Container to keep data structures and manage them
 
 8. Running time of an algorithm and big O notation
 
 Growth Rate                          Asymptotic Notation
   > Linear   : single loop       -> 0(n)  => big o of n
   > Quadratic: loop inside loop  -> 0(nÂ²) => big o of n squared
   > Cubic: loop in loop in loop  -> 0(n^3)
   > Constant                     -> 0(1)  => big o of 1
   > Exponential                  -> 0(n^n)
   
 9. Stack Data Structure
 
   > LIFO = Last in, first out
   > Push to add, pop to remove, always in the top of structure
   > Implementation: use a array to keep the values and an integer to pointer the position of the last item inserted
   > A practical example of use of Stack is to reverse a String or to resolve math problems with parenthesis
